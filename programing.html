            Programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to obtain a particular computational result, or to perform a particular action. Programming includes operations such as: analyzing, creating algorithms, plotting the accuracy of algorithms and resource consumption, and implementing those algorithms in a selected programming language.</p>

            Python is an object-oriented, interpretive, high-level, and all-purpose programming language, designed by Khido van Rossum, first published in 1991. The main philosophy of Python design is "high readability of the code" and the spaces of the space are meaningful and are used frequently. The structure and object-oriented language structure in Python is designed to allow the programmer to write clear, logical code for small and large projects.</p>
